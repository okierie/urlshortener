# urlshortener
 This is a simple `shortening` URL machine. 
 It uses the Codeigniter 2.1.3 framework to control the URL-redirecting and user tracking.

#first thing to do
 Before you run and try this application, please import the (example) database located in `database` directory, the file name is url_short.sql.
#what are the functions inside
 > the generator of the short url
 
 > url validator => validate the url and to check if the url has been shorten and saved before (already exist)
 
 > url redirector=> redirecting shortened url to it's plain url

#note:
 I don't know if you have getting trouble such as "HTTP Error 500 - Internal Server Error" or something else.
 You can see the running application at http://o.hol.es/
